Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dynasim))
The following error was detected at time: 1.000000000001

Model error - Modelica.Math.log (20000.0/(20000.0-E.i)) = Modelica.Math.log (-21.1717)

First evaluation failed for non-linear solver.

The following error was detected at time: 1.000000000001

Model error - Modelica.Math.log (20000.0/(20000.0-E.i)) = Modelica.Math.log (-21.1717)

Non-linear solver will attempt to handle this problem.

ERROR: Failed to solve non-linear system using Newton solver.
 It could be that:
* the starting values are too far from the solution
 - especially if this occurs at the starting point (see homotopy in the manual) - in rare cases it could occur at events
 * the equations are too discontinuous for the non-linear solver (likely due to over-using noEvent) - the residual will have knees,
 * the equations have no solution (note that in some cases the event-logic can cause this) - the residual will be above zero.
Jacobian has inverse norm 5.39651e-12 and condition number 1.
The residual is large, using better start values can be a solution.
